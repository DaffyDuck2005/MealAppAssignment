# MealApp

## What it is

MealApp is a simple app for Android phones that helps you decide what to eat.  If you're not sure what to have for breakfast, lunch, or dinner (or any time in between!), this app will give you a random suggestion.

## How it Works

You tell the app what time of day it is (like "Morning", "Dinner", or "Afternoon"), and it will pick a random meal idea from a list.  The app understands different ways of writing the time â€“ you can use capital letters or lowercase, and it doesn't matter if you add extra spaces.  For example, "  MiD mOrNiNg  " works just as well as "mid morning".

If you enter a time that the app doesn't recognize, it will ask you to try again with a valid time.

## What You Need

To use this app, you'll need:

*   An Android phone or an Android emulator (a way to run Android apps on your computer).
*   To install the app on your phone or emulator.

## Getting the App

If you want to try the app yourself, you'll need to get the code onto your computer and build it into an app that your phone can use. Here's how:

1.  **Get the code:** If the code is on GitHub (an online place to store code), you can download it by "cloning" the repository. You'll need to use a program called "Git" for this. The command looks like this:
